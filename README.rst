Muninn S5P extension
====================

This module provides a namespace extension and a product type extension for Sentinel-5P products for use in Muninn archives.

You can use this module as-is, but you can also use it as a template.
Depending on your use case you might want to adapt the module and use a different product type naming convention
(e.g. without mission and/or file class components),
have the ``analyse()`` function return properties for additional namespaces that you may have, etc.
